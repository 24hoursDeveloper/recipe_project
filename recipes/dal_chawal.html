  <h2>Authentic Dal Chawal Recipe - A Comforting Indian Classic</h2>
  <h2>Introduction:</h2>
  <p>Indulge in the soul-satisfying simplicity of Dal Chawal, a quintessential Indian dish that transcends cultural
    boundaries and embodies comfort in every bite. This time-honored recipe combines two staples—lentils (dal) and rice
    (chawal)—creating a symphony of flavors and textures that are both hearty and nutritious.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Split Red Lentils (Masoor Dal)</li>
    <li>Basmati Rice</li>
    <li>Ghee (Clarified Butter)</li>
    <li>Cumin Seeds</li>
    <li>Onions, Tomatoes, and Garlic</li>
    <li>Turmeric, Cumin, and Coriander Powder</li>
    <li>Green Chilies</li>
    <li>Fresh Coriander (Cilantro)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Rinse and Soak:</b>
      <p>Begin by rinsing the lentils and rice thoroughly. Soak them separately for about 30 minutes to enhance their
        texture.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Sauté Aromatics:</b>
      <p> In a pot, heat ghee and sauté cumin seeds until they sizzle. Add finely chopped onions, garlic, and green
        chilies. Cook until the onions turn golden brown.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Spice it Up:</b>
      <p> Introduce turmeric, cumin, and coriander powder, allowing the spices to bloom and infuse the kitchen with
        their aromatic charm.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Tomato Tango:</b>
      <p>Stir in chopped tomatoes, letting them soften and release their juices. This creates a flavorful base for the
        dal.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Simmer the Dal:</b>
      <p>Combine soaked lentils with the aromatic mixture. Add water and let it simmer until the dal achieves a creamy
        consistency. Season with salt to taste.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Cook the Rice:</b>
      <p>Meanwhile, cook the soaked rice to perfection. The long grains should remain separate and fluffy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Cook the Rice:</b>
      <p>Plate the dal and rice side by side. Garnish with fresh coriander and serve hot, with a drizzle of ghee for
        that extra touch of indulgence.</p>
